# Codeworks coding style guide

This is a reference to the style conventions that we use at Codeworks.

## General

Set up your code editor to:

- Indent with 2 spaces
- Use only spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Avoid trailing whitespaces

## HTML

- Write classes and ids in lowercase, separating words with dashes.

```html
<div class="my-class" id="my-id"></div>
```
